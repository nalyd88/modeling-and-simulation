Includes:
* Uniform distribution and normal distribution Random Number Generators (RNG) implemented in Python
* Cellular Automata (CA) simulation of pedestrian egress implemented in Python (Project #1)
* Heart Rate and Electrocardiogram Simulation (Project #2)
* Other practice simulations 

*****
Note: all simulation software written in Python 2.7.
