This model may be employed to assess biomedical signal processing techniques which are used to compute clinical statistics from the ECG.

Having the ability to vary ECG signal parameters like noise level and sample rate will allow researchers to test ECG signal processing techniques and algorithms for specific situations.
More thoroughly test algorithms under specific conditions

Each beat of the heart can be observed as a series of deflections away from the baseline on the ECG. 

This paper gives a great description of the electrical phenomena behind each characteristic dip or peak in the ECG signal.

They model the ECG signal as a 3-D periodic signal going around in a circle. the amplitude (z direction) of the signal changes to represent the events during the cycle. the locations of these events are determined by angles (locations in the circle). 
3-D state space

Variations in the length of the RR interval can be achieved by varying the angular velocity at which the signal travels around the circle.

The operator can select specific characteristics about the HR such as mean, SD, and spectral properties like LF/HF ratio (corresponds to HRV).

Having access to a realistic ECG provides a benchmark for testing numerous biomedical signal processing techniques. In order to establish the operational properties of these techniques in a clinical setting, it is important to know how they perform for different noise levels and sampling frequencies.
