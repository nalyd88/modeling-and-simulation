MET: a metabolic measure equivalent to 3.5 ml of oxygen per kilogram of body mass per minute (3.5 ml/kg/min). One MET is the resting level of metabolic activity for the average person.

Stroke volume is then estimated by dividing the cardiac output by heart rate.

In the cardiovascular model, heart rate is driven by oxygen need.

the level of exercise combined with the body mass of the subject determines how much oxygen is needed, and heart rate will increase or decrease to meet this need

Cardiac Output = Stroke Volume Ã— Heart Rate
